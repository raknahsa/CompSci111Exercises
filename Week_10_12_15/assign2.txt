---Scores.java---
What is the problem?
Find average of set of scores except for the lowest and the highest
Input: First number of judges and then each score(ex. first enter 5 and the 5 scores separated by new line)
Output: Average of Scores(Disregard highest and lowest score when finding average)

Possible Errors:
Number of Judges Less than 2: Program will disregard and ask again
Score less than 0 or greater than 10: Program will ask for another score(IO Bad Input Error Response)
Non-Numerical Input: IO.readInt()/IO.readDouble() will take care of it

Test Cases:(more than 2 judges)
(Error cases not included as program will disregard previous response and only continue when correct input is entered)

Input             |     Expected Output     |    Program Output
------------------------------------------------------------------
4, 1, 2, 3, 4     |     2.5                 |    2.5
3, 1.0, 2.3, 7.8  |     2.3                 |    2.3

---TwoSmallest.java---
What is the problem?
Find the two smallest numbers from a list of numbers
Input: First enter the terminating number and then enter the list of numbers(separated by new line) and then the terminating number
ex. 6(terminating number), 34, 23, 78, 90 , 6(end of list)
Output: Two smallest numbers

Possible Errors:
Terminating Number entered twice (no numbers in list) : Program will disregard and ask for another value
Only 1 number in list(termintating -> value -> terminating) : Program will disregard and ask for another value
Non-Numerical Input: IO.readDouble() will take care of it

Test Cases:(numbers are negative, numbers are mixed, numbers are positive,smallest numbers are the same)
(Error cases not included as program will disregard previous response and only continue when correct input is entered)
Input                    |     Expected Output      |    Program Output
------------------------------------------------------------------
23, 0, 1, 2, 3, 23       |     0, 1                 |    0, 1
0 , -1, -8, -10, 0       |     -10, -8              |    -10, -8
-9,-3, 23, 2, 1 ,-9      |      -3, 1               |    -3, 1
1, 2, 3, -3, -3, 1       |      -3, -3              |    -3, -3

---NthPrime.java---
What is the problem?
Find the nth prime number
Input: Which number to find(1 is first number , 3 is second number, 5 is fifth number, etc.)
Output: The nth prime number( 1 is 2, 3 is 5, 1000 is 7919, etc)

Possible Errors:
Negative number for N: Program will ask for another input
Non-Numerical Input: IO.readInt() will take care of it
Non-Integer Input: IO.readInt() will take care of it

Test Cases:(Since only non error possible input is numbers greater than 1, a few tests of same type have been given)
(Error cases not included as program will disregard previous response and only continue when correct input is entered)
Input              |     Expected Output      |    Program Output
------------------------------------------------------------------
1                  |     2                    |    2
2                  |     3                    |    3
50                 |     229                  |    229
1000               |     7919                 |    7919
